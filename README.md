# Mutational Signatures Data

This repository contains Python scripts to ingest and process data for [mutational signature analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutational_signatures), from public datasets in the [International Consortium for Cancer and Genomics (ICGC) Data Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/), with an emphasis on adherence to [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

## Consuming ICGC Data
The jupyter notebook `notebooks/Consuming ICGC Data.ipynb` shows how to consume simple somatic mutation data from the ICGC Data Portal via its [APIs](https://docs.icgc.org/portal/api-endpoints/).

## Processing ICGC simple somatic mutation data
The jupyter notebook `notebooks/Processing ICGC Data.ipynb` shows how to process the simple somatic mutation (SSM) data that we downloaded from the ICGC Data Portal. After processing the SSM dataset, we generate a mutational spectra matrix, which tallys the counts for each context (as determined by the base on the 5' and the 3' ends of the mutated allele) of single base substitution. To obtain the context of the substitution, we require the GRCh37 reference genome. We obtain this genome via the [UCGC Genome Browser API](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html).
