# Mutational Signatures Data

This repository contains Python scripts to ingest and process data for [mutational signature analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutational_signatures), from public datasets in the [International Consortium for Cancer and Genomics (ICGC) Data Portal](https://dcc.icgc.org/), with an emphasis on adherence to [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

## Consuming ICGC Data
The jupyter notebook `notebooks/Consuming ICGC Data.ipynb` shows how to consume simple somatic mutation data from the ICGC Data Portal via its [APIs](https://docs.icgc.org/portal/api-endpoints/).
